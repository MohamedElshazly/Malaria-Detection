# **Malaria-Detection**

This is a model that detects whether a patient has malaria or not in a thin blood smeared image with an accuracy of 97.2%. 

## **What's Malaria ?** 


Malaria is a life-threatening disease. Itâ€™s typically transmitted through the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. Infected mosquitoes carry the Plasmodium parasite. When this mosquito bites you, the parasite is released into your bloodstream.

Once the parasites are inside your body, they travel to the liver, where they mature. After several days, the mature parasites enter the bloodstream and begin to infect red blood cells.

Within 48 to 72 hours, the parasites inside the red blood cells multiply, causing the infected cells to burst open.

The parasites continue to infect red blood cells, resulting in symptoms that occur in cycles that last two to three days at a time.

Malaria is typically found in tropical and subtropical climates where the parasites can live. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that, in 2016, there were an estimated 216 million cases of malaria in 91 countries.

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report 1,700 cases of malaria annually. Most cases of malaria develop in people who travel to countries where malaria is more common.

**I used fastai to create the model and train it.**

**I also used resnet50 in my training and u could find the trained model in tmp/models/model-2.pth (~300mb).**

**And used the framework starlette to create the server side**

**To learn more about starlette go here : https://www.starlette.io/**

**to run the Web app locally u need to run the requirements.txt file**
      
      pip install -r requirements.txt
